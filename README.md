# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-KNIME
<p>Predict telecom customer churn using machine learning models built in KNIME, and generate actionable business insights to reduce churn.</p>

## 🔍 Overview
<p>This project uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset to identify factors contributing to customer attrition. Using KNIME, the project covers data preprocessing, EDA, model training, performance evaluation, and business recommendations.</p>

## ✅ Key Contributions

### 🧠 Built and evaluated predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) using a 70/30 train-test split.
Result: Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy, making it the optimal model for churn prediction.

### 📊 Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover critical churn patterns, including:
<ul>
  <li>Month-to-month contracts showing highest churn rates</li>
  <li>Shorter tenure among churned customers</li>
  <li>High monthly charges correlated with churn</li>
</ul>

### 💡 Delivered business recommendations such as:
<ul>
  <li>Rewarding long-tenured customers</li>
  <li>Proactive outreach to customers with high charges</li>
  <li>Enhancing customer support for retention</li>
</ul>

## ✅ Recommendations
<p>
  Based on model insights and EDA, the following recommendations were made:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Reward long-tenured customers through loyalty programs to incentivize continued engagement.</li>
  <li>Proactively contact customers with high monthly charges and offer tailored packages or discounts to reduce churn risk.</li>
  <li>Target month-to-month contract users with incentives to switch to longer-term plans.</li>
  <li>Improve customer support quality and responsiveness, especially for early-tenure customers, to prevent premature churn.</li>
  <li>Use churn prediction scores in campaigns to prioritize outreach to high-risk segments.</li>
</ul>
