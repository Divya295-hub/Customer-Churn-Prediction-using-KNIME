# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-KNIME
<p>Predict telecom customer churn using machine learning models built in KNIME, and generate actionable business insights to reduce churn.</p>

## 🔍 Overview
<p>This project uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset to identify factors contributing to customer attrition. Using KNIME, the project covers data preprocessing, EDA, model training, performance evaluation, and business recommendations.</p>

## ✅ Key Contributions

### 🧠 Built and evaluated predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) using a 70/30 train-test split.
Result: Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy, making it the optimal model for churn prediction.

### 📊 Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover critical churn patterns, including:
<ul>
  <li>Month-to-month contracts showing highest churn rates</li>
  <li>Shorter tenure among churned customers</li>
  <li>High monthly charges correlated with churn</li>
</ul>

### 💡 Delivered business recommendations such as:
<ul>
  <li>Rewarding long-tenured customers</li>
  <li>Proactive outreach to customers with high charges</li>
  <li>Enhancing customer support for retention</li>
</ul>
